# Data Preprocessing (Numeric features)

This repo is created just for personal use (feel free to use any part of the code)

1. StandardScaler-example
This is an example for StandardScaler (for Numeric features )

2. RobustScaler-example
This is an example for RobustScaler  (for Numeric features)

3. Normalization And Cosine Similarity

4. Factor Analysis (and Classification)

5. Outlier Detection using Local Outlier Factor (LOF)

6. Outlier Detection using Isolation Forest

7. Outlier Detection using EllipticEnvelope

8. Artificial-Datasets (To generate sample data for classification, regression, clustering, etc.)

9. Data pre-processing: in this notebook, I have tried to find out the hidden missing values and impute them with the mean. Besides, a classification model has been used for creating a prediction model for diabetes dataset.
